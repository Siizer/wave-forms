# Sinusoidal Waveform Visualizer

This project provides a visualization of three sinusoidal waveforms. Users can adjust the amplitude, phase, and angle of each individual sine wave, providing an interactive way to understand and analyze the properties of sinusoidal functions.

## Features

- Display three distinct sinusoidal waveforms.
- Interactive controls to modify amplitude, phase, and angle for each waveform.
- Clean and intuitive user interface.

## Usage

- Use the provided controls to adjust the amplitude, phase, and angle of each sine wave.
- Observe the changes in the waveforms in real-time as you modify the parameters.
- Reset to default settings if required.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the structure and layout of the waveform visualizer.
